        <h1 className='text-2xl font-normal text-orange-500 text-start my-2'>WHY PRIVATE AVIATION ?</h1>
        <p className='text-base text-gray-500 '>
        Flying commercially provides you with just two choices, coach or first class. Charter Jet One clients have an entire fleet of luxury private jets at their disposal. We recognize that travel needs are as specialized and unique as our clients-thatâ€™s why we have access to over 5,000 private aircraft available worldwide including: fuel efficient turbo props, sleek light jets, versatile medium and super medium jets, luxurious heavy jets and even helicopters. The professional pilots we use are the best and the brightest of private aviation. Every pilot exceeds FAA requirements and has a minimum of 5,000 hours of flight experience on a specific type of private aircraft. All the luxury private jets are furnished to your specifications, and are maintained and inspected according to criteria that go above and beyond what the FAA requires, including being audited by independent auditors Wyvern or ARG/US, the highest level of industry standard in private aviation. All private aircraft are certified under FAA Regulations Part 135 as well, something our competition unfortunately cannot say. (See our post on Illegal Jet Charters)
